Creates or overwrites a file at the specified path.

When to use:
- Creating new files explicitly required by the task
- Replacing entire file contents when editing would be more complex

Critical requirements:
- Prefer Edit tool for modifying existing files (more precise, preserves formatting)
- Create documentation files (*.md, README) only when explicitly requested
- Include emojis only when explicitly requested
